# News Summarization and Text-to-Speech Application

A web-based application that extracts key details from multiple news articles related to a given company, performs sentiment analysis, conducts a comparative analysis, and generates a text-to-speech (TTS) output in Hindi.

## Overview

This application allows users to input a company name and receive a structured sentiment report along with an audio output. The tool extracts information from at least 10 unique news articles, analyzes sentiment, compares coverage across sources, and provides an audio summary in Hindi.

## Features

- **News Extraction**: Extracts the title, summary, and metadata from 10+ news articles related to the input company. News data is scraped from the Times of India website using `BeautifulSoup4`
- **Sentiment & Summarization Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is performed using the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model. Summarization is done with the `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 open-source model`.Topic extraction is handled using `KeyBERT`.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment distribution across multiple articles to identify differences in coverage.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the summarized content into Hindi speech.Translation is done using `GoogleTranslator`.Hindi audio is generated using `gTTS`.
- **User Interface**: Simple web interface built with `Streamlit`
- **API Integration**: Communication between frontend and backend via `RESTful APIs`

## Assumptions and Limitations

- **News Sources**: The application focuses on accessible, non-JavaScript news sources that can be scraped with BeautifulSoup.
- **Language**: Primary analysis is done in English before translation to Hindi for TTS.
- **Company Coverage**: Assumes the input company has at least 10 recent news articles available.
- **Rate Limiting**: Web scraping respects rate limits to avoid being blocked by news sites.
- **Processing Time**: Due to the comprehensive analysis, results may take 20-25 seconds to generate.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more languages
- Implement more sophisticated topic modeling
- Expand company database with historical data
- Add visualization components for sentiment trends
